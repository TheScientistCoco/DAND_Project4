(1) For the third data source, tweet_json.txt, I showed the complete code that helps download the data via API to the tweet-json.txt file.

(2) There are only two tidiness issues (merging the three data sets in one, combining the columns doggo, puppo, pupper, floofer into a single column), I corrected them to the proper list.

(3) I added the Define/Code/Test framework for the data cleaning process. I used multiple Define/Code/Test headers for each of the quality and tidiness issues.

(4) For dog stage, there are some rows with multiple dog stages, I adopted the suggestion and included both stages in the stage column, separated by comma.

(5) I update one visualisation wherever dog stage is used (average rating vs. stage).

(6) In the act report I updated two figures with dog stage (from No.5).
